# Feature Selection Method for Network Intrusion Detection
Machine learning now has a major contribution in cyber security attacks detection especially DDoS attacks. In order to build a strong machine learning model for security systems, there is a need to focus on the most important part in model development, the data pre-processing stage. 
We focuses on feature selection which is the most critical stage in data pre-processing. we implemented four different feature selection techniques: filtering, wrapper, entropy and granular computing and embedded techniques.

For our study, we selected two datasets corresponding to the particular application domain of intrusion detection.
In the first part of our project, we split our experiments into a multiclass problem and a binary problem using the NSL_KDD and the CICIDS2017 datasets, respectively.
