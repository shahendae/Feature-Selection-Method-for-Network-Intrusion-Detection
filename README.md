# Feature-Selection-Method-for-Denial-of-Service-Attack-Detection
Machine learning now has a major contribution in cyber security attacks detection especially DDoS attacks. In order to build a strong machine learning model for security systems, there is a need to focus on the most important part in model development, the data pre-processing stage. 
We focuses on feature selection which is the most critical stage in data pre-processing. First, we implemented four different feature selection techniques: filtering, wrapper, entropy and granular computing and embedded techniques.
